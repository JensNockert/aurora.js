Aurora.js
================================================================================

Highly work in progress, going through a big amount of thinking right now.

If you want to see the prototypes in action, check out [ALAC.js](https://github.com/ofmlabs/alac.js) or [FLAC.js](https://github.com/ofmlabs/flac.js).

To build, run build/build from the root using a recent Ruby (I tested with 1.9.3, but shouldn't matter) with the ExecJS gem installed.

To test, use js-test-driver from http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/downloads/list, they have a quick start guide. Do not forget to rebuild after doing any changes.
